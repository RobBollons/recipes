## Ingredients
 * 400g Whole Wheat Bread Flour
 * 100g White Bread Flour
 * 7g Dry Yeast
 * 4 tbsp Rosemary
 * 50ml Olive Oil
 * 1/2 Pint Hand Warm Water
 * 1 Heaped tsp of Regular Salt
 * 1 tbsp Brown Sugar
 * Sea Salt crystals to Garnish

## Method
1. Mix together the flours, yeast, salt and 2 tbsp of Rosemary in a large mixing bowl.
2. In a separate jug, mix together the olive oil, water and brown sugar then add to the mixing bowl.
3. Blend the mixture together with a wooden spoon until it can be kneaded with the hands.
4. Knead the dough for around 10 minutes.
5. Smooth out the dough into a ball and place into the mixing bowl, then cover with cling film and leave in a warm spot until roughly doubled in size.
6. Rub oil into a baking tray to make sure the dough doesn't stick and then press out the dough into the tray so it's evenly flat and roughly 3cm deep.
7. Cover the tray with cling film and leave to rise in a warm spot until it's doubled in size again. Before it's risen fully, preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
8. Using the handle end of a wooden spoon, dib a series of craters roughly 2-3 inch intervals apart.
9. Pour a liberal splash of olive oil over the top of the dough, this will run into the holes.
10. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tbsp of Rosemary over the top as well as a few liberal pinches of sea salt crystals.
11. Place in the oven for around 20 mins until it's browning on top.
12. Leave on a drying rack to cool and then cut into snack size squares.

Best enjoyed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip.
